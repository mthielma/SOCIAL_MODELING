\section{Abstract}

Hei M\"ase, we should first define what we mean by social and physical forces. I'm not sure if there is something like social forces between an agent and a wall. I mean normally there is not...

I don't know how to make bold characters

\section{Introduction and Motivations}

\section{Description of the Model}

\subsection{Social forces}
\subsubsection{Repulsive forces}

The "social" repulsive force defined here for the walls/buildings can be written in mathematical terms as

\begin{equation}
	{f_{iWS}} = \left\{ {{A_i}\exp \left[ {\frac{{\left( {{r_i} - {d_{iW}}} \right)}}{{{B_i}}}} \right]} \right\}{n_{iW}}
	\label{eq:fiWS}
\end{equation}

where $A_i$ and $B_i$ are constants, $n_{iW}$ is the normalized vector pointing from the pedestrian to the wall, $d_{iW}$ is the distance in between and $r_i$ is the size (i.e. radius) of the pedestrian (Helbing et al., 2000).

The physical wall forces can be divided into a normal force acting from the wall and written as

\begin{equation}
	{f_{iWPn}} = \left\{ {kg\left( {{r_i} - {d_{iW}}} \right)} \right\}{n_{iW}}
	\label{eq:fiWPn}
\end{equation}

and a tangential force

\begin{equation}
	{f_{iWPt}} = \left\{ {\kappa g\left( {{r_i} - {d_{iW}}} \right)\left( {{v_i} \cdot {t_{iW}}} \right)} \right\}{t_{iW}}
	\label{eq:fiWPt}
\end{equation}

where the function $g$ is zero if the pedestrian does not touch the wall, $k$ and $\kappa$ are large constants and $(v_i \cdot t_{iW})$ is the tangential velocity difference.

\begin{equation}
	{f_{iW}} = {f_{iWS}} + {f_{iWPn}} - {f_{iWPt}}
	\label{eq:fiW}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Walking speed}
\subsection{Flooding}

\section{Implementation}
This section is meant to both give an overview of the methods used in this code as well as to provide a documentation of the code. Therefore, some details are mentioned here that might not be crucial for any code that simulates pedestrian dynamics, but are needed in our implementation. 
\subsection{Initialization of Buildings and Agents}
\subsection{Social forces}

\subsubsection{Architecture forces}

Eq. \eqref{eq:fiWS} can be rewritten as

\begin{equation}
	{f_{iWS}} = \left\{ {{A_i}\left( {\exp \left[ {\frac{{ - {d_{iW}}}}{{{B_i}}}} \right] \cdot \exp \left[ {\frac{{{r_i}}}{{{B_i}}}} \right]} \right)} \right\}{n_{iW}}
	\label{eq:fiWS2}
\end{equation}

\section{Simulation Results and Discussion}
\subsection{Simple evacuation bottleneck: One exit}
\subsubsection{direct exit force}

The simplest version of our code has one exit (Fig. \ref{fig:test1}). The attractive force on the agents is defined to be linear towards the exit, thereby neglecting obstacles in between. The agents will not move towards an opening in an obstacle but toward the exit itself. Moreover, this formulation inhibits the agents of running around a bigger obstacle. This is a strong simplification but suitable to test the code.
The behavior of the agents towards the repulsive walls and towards each other is satisfactory.
