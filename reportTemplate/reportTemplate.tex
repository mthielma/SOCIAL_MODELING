\section{Abstract}

Hei M\"ase, we should first define what we mean by social and physical forces. I'm not sure if there is something like social forces between an agent and a wall. I mean normally there is not...

I don't know how to make bold characters

\subsubsection{Repulsive forces}
\subsubsection{Attractive forces}
\subsection{Physical forces}
\subsection{Walking speed}
\subsection{Flooding}

\section{Implementation}
This section is meant to both give an overview of the methods used in this code as well as to provide a documentation of the code. Therefore, some details are mentioned here that might not be crucial for any code that simulates pedestrian dynamics, but are needed in our implementation. 
\subsection{Initialization of Buildings and Agents}
\subsection{Social forces}
\subsubsection{Architecture forces}
\begin{equation}
	{f_{iWS}} = \left\{ {{A_i}\exp \left[ {\frac{{\left( {{r_i} - {d_{iW}}} \right)}}{{{B_i}}}} \right]} \right\}{n_{iW}}
	\label{eq:fiWS}
\end{equation}

Eq. \eqref{eq:fiWS} can be rewritten as

\begin{equation}
	{f_{iWS}} = \left\{ {{A_i}\left( {\exp \left[ {\frac{{ - {d_{iW}}}}{{{B_i}}}} \right] \cdot \exp \left[ {\frac{{{r_i}}}{{{B_i}}}} \right]} \right)} \right\}{n_{iW}}
	\label{eq:fiWS2}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Exit forces}
\subsubsection{Agent forces}
\subsection{Physical forces}

\subsubsection{Wall forces}
\begin{equation}
	{f_{iWPn}} = \left\{ {kg\left( {{r_i} - {d_{iW}}} \right)} \right\}{n_{iW}}
	\label{eq:fiWPn}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	{f_{iWPt}} = \left\{ {kg\left( {{r_i} - {d_{iW}}} \right)\left( {{v_i} \cdot {t_{iW}}} \right)} \right\}{t_{iW}}
	\label{eq:fiWPt}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	{f_{iW}} = {f_{iWS}} + {f_{iWPn}} - {f_{iWPt}}
	\label{eq:fiW}
\end{equation}


\subsubsection{Agent forces}
\subsection{Walking speed}
\subsection{Flooding}
